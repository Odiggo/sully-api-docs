description: "Learn how to authenticate with the Sully.ai Alpha API to access experimental features like medical consensus and note templates."

## Overview

The Sully.ai Alpha API uses the same authentication system as our stable API. All requests must include a valid API key in the Authorization header.

<Warning>
  **Alpha API Notice**: This is an experimental version of our API. Features may change without notice and should not be used in production environments without careful consideration.
</Warning>

## API Key Authentication

All Alpha API requests require authentication using your API key:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Getting Your API Key

1. Sign up for a Sully.ai account at [dashboard.api.sully.ai](https://dashboard.api.sully.ai)
2. Navigate to the API Keys section in your dashboard
3. Generate a new API key or use an existing one
4. Copy the key and store it securely

<Warning>
  **Keep your API key secure**: Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories. Store it as an environment variable or in a secure configuration file.
</Warning>

## Base URL

The Alpha API uses the same base URL as our stable API:

```
https://api.sully.ai
```

Alpha endpoints are prefixed with `/alpha/` to distinguish them from stable endpoints.

## Example Request

Here's how to make an authenticated request to the Alpha API:

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.sully.ai/alpha/consensus" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What are the treatment options for Type 2 diabetes?"
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.sully.ai/alpha/consensus', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "What are the treatment options for Type 2 diabetes?"
  })
});

const data = await response.json();
```

```python Python
import requests
import os

url = "https://api.sully.ai/alpha/consensus"
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('SULLY_API_KEY')}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
data = {
    "query": "What are the treatment options for Type 2 diabetes?"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
result = response.json()
```

## Error Responses

### 401 Unauthorized

If your API key is missing or invalid, you'll receive a 401 error:

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid or missing API key"
}
```

### 403 Forbidden

If your account doesn't have access to alpha features:

```json
{
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "message": "Alpha API access not enabled for this account"
}
```

## Rate Limiting

Alpha API endpoints may have different rate limits than stable endpoints:

- **Medical Consensus**: Limited per day based on your plan
- **Note Templates**: Limited per request based on complexity
- **Rate limit headers**: Check response headers for current limits
- **Exceeded limits**: Results in 429 Too Many Requests

Rate limit information is included in response headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

## Best Practices

### Environment Variables

Store your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export SULLY_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### Error Handling

Always handle authentication errors gracefully:

```javascript
async function makeAuthenticatedRequest(endpoint, data) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.sully.ai${endpoint}`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.SULLY_API_KEY}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(data)
    });

    if (response.status === 401) {
      throw new Error('Invalid API key');
    }

    if (response.status === 403) {
      throw new Error('Alpha API access not enabled');
    }

    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Authentication error:', error.message);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Testing

Test your authentication with a simple request:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.sully.ai/alpha/consensus" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Alpha API Features

Current alpha features include:

- **Medical Consensus**: Get expert medical opinions on clinical queries
- **Note Templates**: Generate note templates from provider notes
- **Advanced Analytics**: Enhanced insights and reporting (coming soon)
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Intelligent suggestions for clinical workflows (coming soon)

## Support

For alpha API issues:

- Email: [support@sully.ai](mailto:support@sully.ai)
- Include "Alpha API" in your subject line
- Provide your account ID and request details

## Migration to Stable

When alpha features graduate to stable:

1. We'll announce the migration timeline
2. Endpoints will be available at both `/alpha/` and stable paths
3. You'll have time to update your integration
4. Alpha endpoints will eventually be deprecated

Stay updated on our [blog](https://www.sully.ai/blog) for alpha feature announcements and migration guides.
