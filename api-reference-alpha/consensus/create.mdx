## Next Steps

After creating a consensus request:

1. **Poll for results**: Use the [Get Consensus](/api-reference-alpha/consensus/get) endpoint with the returned ID to check the status and retrieve results
2. **Clean up**: Use the [Delete Consensus](/api-reference-alpha/consensus/delete) endpoint to remove requests you no longer need
