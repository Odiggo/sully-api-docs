However, several differential diagnoses should be considered including pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, and myocarditis. Immediate ECG and chest X-ray are recommended, along with serial troponin measurements. Consider CT pulmonary angiogram if PE is suspected, and cardiology consultation is recommended."

## Status Codes

<ResponseField name="200" type="OK">

## Polling for Results

Since consensus requests are processed asynchronously, you may need to poll this endpoint periodically to check for completion:

```javascript
async function waitForConsensus(consensusId) {
  let status = 'pending';
  
  while (status === 'pending' || status === 'processing') {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.sully.ai/alpha/consensus/${consensusId}`, {
      headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' }
    });
    
    const data = await response.json();
    status = data.data.status;
    
    if (status === 'completed') {
      return data.data;
    }
    
    if (status === 'failed') {
      throw new Error('Consensus processing failed');
    }
    
    // Wait 5 seconds before polling again
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
  }
}
```
