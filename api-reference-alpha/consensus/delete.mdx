## Overview

## Use Cases

### Cleanup Completed Requests

Delete old consensus requests that are no longer needed:

```javascript
async function cleanupOldRequests() {
  // Get all requests
  const response = await fetch('https://api.sully.ai/alpha/consensus', {
    headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' }
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  const oldRequests = data.data.filter(request => {
    const createdDate = new Date(request.createdAt);
    const thirtyDaysAgo = new Date();
    thirtyDaysAgo.setDate(thirtyDaysAgo.getDate() - 30);
    
    return createdDate < thirtyDaysAgo && request.status === 'completed';
  });

  // Delete old requests
  for (const request of oldRequests) {
    await fetch(`https://api.sully.ai/alpha/consensus/${request.id}`, {
      method: 'DELETE',
      headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' }
    });
  }
  
  console.log(`Deleted ${oldRequests.length} old requests`);
}
```

### Cancel Pending Requests

Remove requests that are no longer needed:

```javascript
async function cancelPendingRequest(consensusId) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.sully.ai/alpha/consensus/${consensusId}`, {
      method: 'DELETE',
      headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' }
    });
    
    if (response.ok) {
      console.log('Pending request cancelled successfully');
    } else {
      console.error('Failed to cancel request');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error cancelling request:', error);
  }
}
```

## Important Notes

1. **Irreversible Action**: Deleted consensus requests cannot be recovered
2. **Results Loss**: Any consensus results will be permanently lost
3. **Billing**: You may still be charged for processing time even if you delete the request
4. **Rate Limiting**: Deletion does not affect your rate limiting quotas
