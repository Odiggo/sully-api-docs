## Creating Notes with Sully.ai 

The Sully.ai API allows you to turn audio conversations into clinical notes, saving you time and improving your documentation quality. Notes are generated using the API in 3 steps:

1. [Transcribe](#1-transcribe-audio) the conversation audio by uploading a file or streaming audio in real-time.
2. [Generate](#2-generate-a-note) a note using the transcription.
3. [Retrieve](#3-retrieve-the-note) the completed note (via webhooks or polling).

## 1. Transcribe Audio

### Upload a File

You can transcribe audio files using the [Create Audio Transcription API](/api-reference/audio-transcriptions/create). First, submit your file for transcription:

<CodeGroup>
  <JSUpload />
</CodeGroup>

Then wait for completion either via webhooks or polling:

<CodeGroup>
  <JSUploadPoll />
</CodeGroup>

Supported file types include MP3, WAV, M4A, and OGG (max 50MB).

### Stream in Real-time

If you are looking to stream audio for transcription during visits, you will first need to [request a token from the API](http://localhost:3001/api-reference/audio-transcriptions/stream-token), then open a WebSocket so that you can pass audio and receive transcriptions in real-time.

<CodeGroup>
  <JSStream />
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Generate A Note

### SOAP Notes

You can generate SOAP notes immediately using Sully's pre-configured note type.

<CodeGroup>
  <JSSoap />
</CodeGroup>

### Custom Note Styles

If Sully's SOAP notes aren't what you're looking for, you can create your own [Note Style](/api-reference/note-styles/create) by providing a sample note for Sully to use as a reference.

<CodeGroup>
  <JSNoteStyle />
</CodeGroup>

### Structured Note Templates

If you need a precise note structure that Note Styles aren't providing, you can instead specify a [Note Template](/api-reference/schemas/note-template). This will allow you to control the fine details of your note formatting such as lists, headers, and section lengths.

<CodeGroup>
  <JSTemplates />
</CodeGroup>

## 3. Retrieve The Note

Notes typically only take a few seconds to generate. You can retrieve your completed note either by polling the notes API or setting up a webhook so that your application may be notified whenever a note or transcription has been completed.

### Poll for Notes

<CodeGroup>
  <JSNotePoll />
</CodeGroup>

### Webhooks

For full webhook setup instructions, follow the [Webhooks guide](/api-reference/events/webhooks). Once set up, your webhook handler will receive [events](/api-reference/events/overview) related to audio transcription and note generation.

<CodeGroup>
  <JSWebhook />
</CodeGroup>

## Language Support

You can specify one of our [supported BCP47 language tags](/api-reference/audio-transcriptions/languages) both when uploading and streaming audio for transcription. Audio which is not in the specified language will be ignored. Or, you can also specify the `multi` tag as the language for multilingual conversations.

<CodeGroup>
  <JSLanguageSupport />
</CodeGroup>

## Specify More Context

If you have additional context programmatically available, you can provide it to Sully's note creation API so that it can be incorporated into your notes.

- **date:** The date of the patient visit.
- **patientInfo:** High-level patient descriptors including name, date of birth, and gender.
- **medicationList:** A list of known patient medications.
- **previousNote:** A previous note needed as context for this note (e.g. if it is a follow-up).
- **instructions:** Additional instructions for how you'd like the note to be generated.
- **context:** Any additional context you'd like to provide.

See the [Create Note API](/api-reference/notes/create) for the up-to-date list of options.
