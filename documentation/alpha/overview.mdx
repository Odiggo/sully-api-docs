The Alpha API provides early access to experimental Sully.ai features. These features are available for evaluation and feedback before they graduate to our stable API.

## What is Alpha?

Alpha features are experimental capabilities that we're actively developing:

- **Early Access**: Try new features before general availability
- **May Change**: APIs and behavior may be modified without notice
- **Not for Production**: Use for evaluation, testing, and feedback only
- **Shape the Product**: Your feedback directly influences feature development

<Warning>
  Alpha features are not recommended for production use. They may change without notice, have different rate limits, and do not include SLA guarantees.
</Warning>

    Get expert medical opinions on clinical queries with AI-powered analysis

</CardGroup>

### Medical Consensus

Submit clinical queries and receive comprehensive medical opinions synthesized from multiple expert sources. Useful for:

- Validating diagnoses and treatment approaches
- Exploring differential diagnoses
- Getting second opinions on complex cases

### Template Generation

Automatically create and refine note templates based on your existing documentation:

- **Generate**: Analyze provider notes to create customized templates
- **Refine**: Improve existing templates with instructions or before/after comparisons

## Alpha vs Stable API

| Aspect | Stable (v1/v2) | Alpha |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| **Authentication** | `X-API-Key` + `X-Account-Id` headers | `Authorization: Bearer` token |
| **Base URL** | `https://api.sully.ai/v1/` | `https://api.sully.ai/alpha/` |
| **Stability** | Production-ready | May change without notice |
| **Support** | Full support | Best-effort |
| **SLA** | Yes | No |
| **Rate Limits** | Standard limits | May have different limits |

---

## Authentication

Alpha endpoints use Bearer token authentication instead of the header-based authentication used by stable endpoints.

### Alpha Authentication

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Comparison with Stable API

<CodeGroup>
```bash Stable API (v1/v2)
curl -X POST "https://api.sully.ai/v1/notes" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Account-Id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"transcript": "..."}'
```

```bash Alpha API
curl -X POST "https://api.sully.ai/alpha/consensus" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "..."}'
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  You use the same API key for both stable and alpha endpoints. Only the header format differs.
</Note>

## Getting Alpha Access

Alpha features are available to all Sully.ai API users:

- **No special signup required** — use your existing API key
- **Immediate access** — alpha endpoints are ready to use
- **Same dashboard** — manage your API keys at [dashboard.api.sully.ai](https://dashboard.api.sully.ai)

Simply use the alpha endpoints with Bearer authentication to start experimenting.

## Stability Expectations

When using alpha features, expect:

| Change Type | Frequency | Notice |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Bug fixes** | Ongoing | None required |
| **Response format changes** | Occasional | Best-effort notification |
| **Endpoint modifications** | Rare | Announced when possible |
| **Feature removal** | Rare | Advance notice provided |

### Best Practices for Alpha Usage

1. **Check documentation regularly** for updates and changes
2. **Build flexible integrations** that handle schema variations gracefully
3. **Don't depend on alpha for critical workflows** until features are stable
4. **Test thoroughly** before any production use
5. **Subscribe to updates** via the [Sully.ai blog](https://www.sully.ai/blog)

## Providing Feedback

Your feedback shapes how alpha features evolve. We want to hear about:

- **Use cases** — How are you using or planning to use these features?
- **Issues** — Bugs, unexpected behavior, or confusing responses
- **Suggestions** — Feature requests and improvement ideas
- **Integration challenges** — Difficulties connecting alpha features to your workflows

### How to Submit Feedback

**Email**: [support@sully.ai](mailto:support@sully.ai)

When submitting feedback:

1. Include **"Alpha Feedback"** in your subject line
2. Specify which alpha feature you're using
3. Describe your use case and any issues encountered
4. Include request IDs and example payloads when relevant

## Migration to Stable

When alpha features graduate to the stable API:

1. **Announcement** — We'll publish a migration timeline
2. **Dual availability** — Features will be available at both alpha and stable paths
3. **Migration period** — You'll have time to update your integration
4. **Deprecation** — Alpha endpoints will be deprecated after the migration period

Stay informed about feature graduation via our [blog](https://www.sully.ai/blog) and documentation updates.
